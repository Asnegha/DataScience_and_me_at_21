> Here is my second project using Mysql.I have created a problem statement myself and drawn conclusion from my EDA of a dataset using Mysql. 

#### Problem statement
> Parrot is a fresher looking for entry-level jobs. The year 2022 is just after COVID ended. Parrot would like to 
analyze the job opening in data-related fields before diving into the job search for a better understanding. Here, we 
took a data science salary dataset from Kaggle and analyzed the entry-level openings.
