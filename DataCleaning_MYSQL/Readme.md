# Data cleaning using Mysql

### Hey all!
> This is my first project. Here I have cleaned a Nashville housing dataset using Mysql.
#### I have addressed 
- Null value handling
- Removal of dupicates
- Formatting the columns
- Creation of new columns from existing one 
- Addressing the inconsistent column. 
> I hope this will help you in your journey of becoming a data scientist.
